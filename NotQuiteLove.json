   "description":"High school girl Sayama Umi is placed in the care of the neighboring Hiroi family while her mother is away on a long business trip. The Hiroi household is home to Shoya, an eight-years-older figure she admires, and Umi's heart races at their long-awaited reunion. But the Shoya she encounters is completely different from the one in her memories. A faintly sparkling cohabitation story about meeting changed memories once more.",
